<p>There have been many people involved in putting this whole thing
together, not that it's rocket science, but their feedback and/or
inspiration have been phenomenal:</p>

<p><b>Dareen Alihiyari</b> along with myself (I toot my own horn) for getting
creative with reasons not to go to the gym in the morning,
the original inspiration.</p>
<p><b>Jo√£o Pacheco</b> for tossing together an awesome logo at breakneck speeds</p>
<p>My friends at the <b>League of Bananas</b> for putting the concept and
software through it's paces. Having a team of developers and designers
to fall back on has proven invaluable.</p>
