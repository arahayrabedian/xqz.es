        <H1>Acknowledgements</H1>

        <p>There have been many people involved in putting this whole thing
        together, not that it's rocket science, but their feedback and/or
        inspiration have been phenomenal. In chronological order:</p>

        <p><b><a href="https://github.com/dareen">Dareen Alihiyari</a></b>
        along with myself (I toot my own horn) for getting
        creative with reasons not to go to the gym in the morning,
        the original inspiration.</p>

        <p><b>Jo√£o Pacheco</b> for tossing together an awesome
        logo at breakneck speeds</p>

        <p><b><a href="http://kumailht.com">Kumail Hunaid</a></b> for
        helping me out by taking the html from the early 90's to the
        modern era.</p>

        <p>My friends at the <b>League of Bananas</b> for putting the concept and
        software through it's paces. Having a team of developers and designers
        to fall back on has proven invaluable.</p>
