        <H1>Submit a New Excuse</H1>

        Due to increasing spam, this feature has been removed from the web interface, to submit an excuse, you can
        still use the slash command on slack. e.g: <span style="background-color:lightgrey; font-family: monospace;">/xqzes add I'm on a train</span>
    </body>
