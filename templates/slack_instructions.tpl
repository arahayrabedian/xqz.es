<H2>How-To Slack</H2>
<div style="width:50%">
<p>We think excuses are an important part of your life. Which is why
we decided to build a slack app.</p>

<p>After setting up the slack app, all you have to do to get an excuse
if somebody's giving you a hard time is call the /xqzes command and we'll
pick a random excuse for you. Some other options are available via the
 '/xqzes help' command, but these merely ancillary.</p>

<p>A final note, some of our excuses <b>are NSFW.</b></p>

<p>To add xqz.es to your team, all you need to do is click the slack button
on the home page (or below) and follow the instructions slack gives you. If you
have any concerns about privacy, you can read our (rather succinct)
<a href=/privacy/>privacy policy</a></p>
